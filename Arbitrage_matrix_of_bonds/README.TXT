In this paper I will try to build a matrix with arbitrage between 2 different bonds
====================================================================================

The calculations are performed at the jupiter notebook using Python 3.7
==============================================================================

Necessary package:
1) Pandas for work with data
2) numpy for advanced use of numbers and formulas
3) matplotlib for graphics
4) seaborn for more graphics
5) requests for get data from website

Usd data will get from moex.com (Moscow Exchange site)
==============================================================================

Any comments and suggestions are welcome auriliano@live.com.
